# ✅ DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP - COMPLETED ITEMS

## MAJOR SYSTEM FIXES COMPLETED

### 🎯 Course-Module-Lab Relationship System (July 19, 2025) - COMPLETE
**Status**: ✅ FULLY RESOLVED

**Issues Fixed**:
1. **Student Dashboard Empty**: Fixed "No modules available yet" issue
2. **Course Saving Failures**: Resolved foreign key constraint errors  
3. **Module View Empty**: Fixed "No Labs Available" in module details
4. **Data Structure Conflicts**: Resolved course_id vs course_code mismatches

**Technical Resolution**:
- ✅ Fixed my-course endpoint to use `course_code` instead of `course_id`
- ✅ Updated all lab queries to use `module_labs` junction table
- ✅ Removed conflicting direct `module_id` references from labs
- ✅ Eliminated `is_published = true` restrictions blocking content
- ✅ Established clean many-to-many relationship structure

**Result**: Students can now see their assigned course modules, instructors can save courses successfully, and the system uses proper many-to-many relationships throughout.
