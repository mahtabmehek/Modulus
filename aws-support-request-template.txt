# AWS Support Request Template for Cognito Rate Limit Increase

Subject: Request to Increase AWS Cognito Password Reset Rate Limits

Dear AWS Support,

I am requesting an increase in the rate limits for AWS Cognito forgot password operations for my User Pool.

**Account Details:**
- AWS Account ID: 376129881409
- User Pool ID: eu-west-2_4vo3VDZa5
- Region: eu-west-2 (London)
- Application: Modulus LMS Platform

**Current Issue:**
- Users are experiencing "Attempt limit exceeded" errors when testing password reset functionality
- Current rate limits are impacting development and user testing

**Request:**
- Increase forgot password attempt limits from current restriction to allow:
  * At least 10 attempts per user per hour
  * Reduced cooldown period to 1-2 minutes instead of current 5+ minutes

**Business Justification:**
- Development environment requires frequent testing of authentication flows
- User experience is critical for our learning management system
- We have proper email verification and other security measures in place

**Expected Timeline:**
- Development phase: Immediate need for testing
- Production launch: [Your expected launch date]

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Company]
