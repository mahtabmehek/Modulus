# ModulusLMS Development Status - Complete Session Summary

## Project Overview
ModulusLMS is a comprehensive learning management system built with Next.js 13+, TypeScript, and JWT authentication.

## Major Completed Features

### 1. UI Refinements (✅ Complete)
- **Dashboard Cleanup**: Removed highlighted descriptions from instructor and admin dashboards
- **Instructor Stats**: Added "Courses" statistic between Students and Labs with BookOpen icon
- **Role-Based Menus**: "Profile and Badges" visible only to students, "Profile" for instructors/admins
- **Admin Dashboard**: Removed statistics cards, simplified to clean "System Admin" title with dark purple gradient

### 2. Authentication System (✅ Complete)
- **JWT Consistency**: Standardized JWT secret across all endpoints to 'modulus-lms-secret-key-change-in-production'
- **Token Issues Resolved**: Fixed "Invalid or expired token" errors through secret standardization
- **Environment Configuration**: Proper .env setup in backend with consistent JWT_SECRET

### 3. Password Management (✅ Complete)
- **Forgot Password**: Dark-themed interface with old password verification (not email reset)
- **Password Change**: Functional API endpoints for secure password updates
- **Profile Cleanup**: Removed password reset from profile page entirely
- **UI Theme**: Consistent dark theme implementation with proper validation

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Structure
- **Next.js 13+**: App router with TypeScript
- **Components**: Role-based conditional rendering
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark theme support
- **Authentication**: JWT token management with localStorage

### Backend Configuration
- **Express.js**: RESTful API with PostgreSQL integration
- **JWT Secret**: 'modulus-lms-secret-key-change-in-production' (consistent across all files)
- **Environment**: Proper .env configuration for database and JWT
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with verification endpoints

## Critical File States

### Authentication Files
- `backend/.env`: JWT_SECRET properly configured
- `backend/index.js`: Consistent JWT secret usage in registration
- `backend/routes/auth.js`: All auth endpoints use unified secret
- `src/utils/api.ts`: Enhanced with password change functionality

### UI Components
- `src/components/dashboards/admin-dashboard.tsx`: Clean purple gradient header, no statistics
- `src/components/dashboards/instructor-dashboard.tsx`: Added Courses stat, removed descriptions
- `src/components/views/forgot-password.tsx`: Complete dark-themed password change interface
- `src/components/layout/header.tsx`: Role-based menu conditional rendering

## Development Environment
- **Tasks Running**: Frontend dev server and backend server active
- **Authentication**: Fully operational with token persistence
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connected and functional
- **UI**: All requested visual improvements implemented

## Key Lessons Learned
1. **JWT Consistency Critical**: Environment variable mismatches cause widespread auth failures
2. **User Experience**: Password reset redesigned from email-based to old password verification
3. **Clean UI**: Minimal design with functional focus preferred over statistics-heavy interfaces

## Current Status
- ✅ All user-requested features implemented
- ✅ Authentication system stable and consistent
- ✅ UI improvements complete with dark theme
- ✅ Password management functional
- ✅ Admin dashboard cleaned up per specifications

## Next Session Preparation
The system is fully functional and ready for use. All major features requested have been implemented:
- Clean, dark-themed UI with role-based features
- Stable JWT authentication across all endpoints
- Functional password management with security focus
- Simplified admin interface without visual clutter

No pending issues or incomplete features remain.
