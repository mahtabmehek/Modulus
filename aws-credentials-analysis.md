# AWS Credentials Analysis Report

## 🔍 **AWS Access Key Analysis**

**Access Key**: `AKIAVPEYWQVAVFG3HKQM`

### **Key Type Identification**

Based on the access key prefix `AKIA`, this is:

✅ **IAM User Access Key** (Standard long-term credentials)

### **What This Means**

| Key Type | Prefix | Description | Risk Level |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **IAM User** | `AKIA` | Long-term credentials for an IAM user | 🟡 **Medium-High** |
| IAM Role (STS) | `ASIA` | Temporary credentials from assumed role | 🟢 Lower |
| Root Account | `AKIA` | Root account access keys | 🔴 **CRITICAL** |

### **🎯 Your Situation: IAM User Credentials**

**Good News**: This is "just" an IAM user, not root account credentials.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Type**: IAM User Access Key (not root account)
- **Duration**: Long-term credentials (don't expire automatically)
- **Risk Level**: **Medium-High** (depends on permissions)

### **🔑 Key Questions to Determine Impact**

1. **What permissions does this IAM user have?**
   - Administrator access? 🔴 Critical
   - Limited service access? 🟡 Medium
   - Read-only access? 🟢 Lower risk

2. **Is this a service account or personal account?**
   - Service account for CI/CD? 🟡 Medium
   - Personal development account? 🟢 Lower
   - Production service account? 🔴 High

3. **What services can it access?**
   - EC2, RDS, S3? 🔴 High impact
   - CloudWatch, logs only? 🟢 Lower impact
   - Billing access? 🔴 Financial risk

### **🚨 Immediate Actions (Regardless of Permissions)**

#### **1. Check Current IAM User Status**
```powershell
# If you have AWS CLI configured:
aws iam get-user --user-name <username>
aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <username>
aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <username>
```

#### **2. Rotate Credentials Immediately**
```powershell
# In AWS Console:
# 1. Go to IAM → Users → [Your User]
# 2. Security credentials tab
# 3. Find access key AKIAVPEYWQVAVFG3HKQM
# 4. Click "Actions" → "Deactivate" (immediately)
# 5. Create new access key
# 6. Update any applications using the old key
```

#### **3. Check CloudTrail for Unauthorized Usage**
```powershell
# Look for activity with the exposed access key
# Check for unusual API calls or resource creation
```

### **🕵️ How to Identify the IAM User**

Since you might not remember which IAM user this key belongs to:

1. **In AWS Console**: 
   - Go to IAM → Access management → Users
   - Check each user's "Security credentials" tab
   - Look for access keys starting with `AKIAVPEYWQVAVFG3HKQM`

2. **If you have AWS CLI access**:
   ```bash
   # This will show which user the current credentials belong to
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```

### **🛡️ Prevention for IAM Users**

1. **Use IAM Roles instead of long-term keys when possible**
2. **Implement key rotation policies**
3. **Use least-privilege permissions**
4. **Enable CloudTrail logging**
5. **Set up AWS Config for compliance monitoring**

### **📊 Risk Matrix**

| User Type | Permissions | Risk Level | Action Required |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Service Account | Admin | 🔴 **CRITICAL** | Immediate rotation + audit |
| Service Account | Limited | 🟡 **HIGH** | Same-day rotation |
| Developer Account | Admin | 🟡 **HIGH** | Same-day rotation |
| Developer Account | Limited | 🟢 **MEDIUM** | This-week rotation |

### **🎯 Bottom Line**

**Yes, this is "just" an IAM user** (not root account), but you still need to:

1. **Rotate the credentials immediately** (regardless of permissions)
2. **Check what permissions this user has**
3. **Audit CloudTrail for any unauthorized usage**
4. **Clean the credentials from Git history**

The good news is that if it's a limited-permission IAM user for development, the blast radius is smaller than if it were root credentials or a highly-privileged service account.
