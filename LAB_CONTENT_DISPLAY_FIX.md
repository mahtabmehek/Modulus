# Lab Content Display Fix - July 19, 2025

## Issue Resolved ✅
**Problem**: Students viewing labs created by instructors were seeing "No instructions provided yet" instead of the actual lab content (tasks, questions, etc.).

## Root Cause
The frontend lab view components (`lab-view.tsx` and `lab-content-view.tsx`) were looking for a simple `instructions` property, but the backend was correctly returning structured data with `tasks` and `questions` arrays.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend API (Working Correctly) ✅
- `/api/labs/:id` endpoint properly returns lab data with tasks and questions
- Each task includes title, description, and questions array
- Each question includes type, title, description, expected answer, and points

### 2. Frontend Updates Made ✅

#### Updated `lab-view.tsx`:
- Replaced simple "Instructions" section with comprehensive "Lab Tasks" display
- Added proper rendering of tasks and questions structure
- Each task is expandable/collapsible
- Questions show different formats based on type (flag, multiple-choice, text)
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for Task and Question
- **NEW**: Added interactive answer input fields for each question type
- **NEW**: Added answer submission functionality with feedback
- **NEW**: Added progress tracking for completed questions

#### Updated `labs.ts` API client:
- Added Task and Question interfaces
- Updated Lab interface to include tasks array
- Updated CreateLabData interface to support tasks

### 3. Interactive Features Added ✅

#### Answer Input Types:
- **Flag Questions**: Text input with submit button
- **Text Questions**: Textarea input with submit button  
- **Multiple Choice**: Radio button selection with submit button

#### Answer Submission:
- Real-time answer validation
- Success/failure feedback
- Visual confirmation for submitted answers
- Prevents re-submission of completed questions

### 4. Data Structure Now Displayed ✅

```typescript
Lab {
  id: number
  title: string
  description: string
  tasks: [
    {
      id: number
      title: string
      description: string
      questions: [
        {
          id: number
          type: 'flag' | 'multiple-choice' | 'text'
          title: string
          description: string
          flag: string // expected answer
          points: number
          multipleChoiceOptions?: string[]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Test Results ✅
- **API Test**: `test-lab-api.js` confirms backend returns complete data structure
- **Lab ID 106**: Contains 2 tasks with 4 total questions
- **Student View**: Now displays all task content properly with interactive inputs
- **Answer Submission**: Students can now submit answers and receive feedback
- **Instructor Edit**: Works correctly (unchanged)

## Files Modified
- `src/components/views/lab-view.tsx` - Main student lab view with interactive features
- `src/lib/api/labs.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and API client
- `test-lab-api.js` - Testing script (kept for future testing)

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED**: Students can now see all lab content created by instructors AND interact with questions by submitting answers and receiving immediate feedback.
