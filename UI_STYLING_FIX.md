# UI Styling Fix for Amplify Deployment

## Problem Identified
The colors and UI look different between local development and Amplify deployment due to:
1. Theme provider hydration mismatches
2. CSS custom properties not being consistently applied in production
3. Next.js static export affecting CSS processing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Theme Configuration Updates
- Changed default theme from "system" to "light" in layout.tsx
- Added theme consistency enforcement for production builds

### 2. CSS Variable Fallbacks
- Added fallback colors in globals.css for production builds
- Ensured CSS variables are properly formatted and spaced

### 3. Production Theme Forcer
- Created ThemeForcer component that enforces consistent styling in production
- Forces light theme and overrides any conflicting styles

### 4. Amplify Build Configuration
- Created amplify.yml with specific build instructions
- Added environment variables for consistent theming

### 5. Environment Files
- Updated .env.production with theme consistency settings
- Ensured proper environment variable loading

## Files Modified
- ✅ src/app/layout.tsx - Theme provider configuration
- ✅ src/app/globals.css - CSS fallbacks added
- ✅ src/components/theme-forcer.tsx - New production theme enforcer
- ✅ .env.production - Production environment variables
- ✅ amplify.yml - Amplify build configuration

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Commit and Push Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix UI styling consistency between dev and production"
   git push origin cognito-timeline
   ```

2. **Deploy to Amplify**
   - The amplify.yml will automatically apply the fixes during build
   - Theme consistency will be enforced in production

3. **Verify After Deployment**
   - Check that colors match local development
   - Verify dark/light theme behavior
   - Test authentication forms styling

## Expected Results
- ✅ Consistent white background and dark text
- ✅ Proper button and form styling
- ✅ Matching colors between dev and production
- ✅ Stable theme behavior across page loads

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, revert these files:
- Remove ThemeForcer import from layout.tsx
- Restore original theme provider settings
- Remove amplify.yml custom build commands
