# Cognito Integration Issues and Solutions

## Issue 1: Email Verification Not Working

**Problem**: Users are not receiving verification emails from AWS Cognito.

**Root Cause**: AWS Cognito uses AWS SES (Simple Email Service) for sending emails. By default:
- SES is in sandbox mode and can only send to verified email addresses
- Default Cognito emails may go to spam folders
- Custom domain verification is required for production

**Immediate Solutions**:

### Option A: Disable Email Verification (Development Only)
This requires updating the Cognito User Pool configuration to not require email verification.

### Option B: Admin Confirm User (Development Testing)
Use AWS CLI to manually confirm test users:
```bash
aws cognito-idp admin-confirm-sign-up \
  --user-pool-id eu-west-2_4vo3VDZa5 \
  --username [USERNAME]
```

### Option C: Use Console Email for Testing
- Check spam/junk folders
- Use a widely supported email provider (Gmail, Outlook)
- Whitelist AWS Cognito emails

## Issue 2: Dashboard Not Showing After Login

**Problem**: User sees "Welcome back!" but login form instead of dashboard.

**Root Cause**: Application expects user objects with `role` and `isApproved` properties from database, but Cognito users only have basic attributes.

**Solution Applied**: Modified auth provider to add default properties:
- `role`: 'student' (default)
- `isApproved`: true (Cognito users are pre-approved)
- `name`: Derived from first/last name or email

## Testing Steps:

1. **Try Signup**: Create account with real email
2. **Check Console**: Browser DevTools → Console for error messages
3. **Manual Confirmation**: If no email, use AWS CLI to confirm user
4. **Test Login**: Attempt login with confirmed credentials

## Production Requirements:

1. **Configure SES**: Set up proper email delivery
2. **Domain Verification**: Verify sending domain
3. **Custom Email Templates**: Brand verification emails
4. **Error Handling**: Improve UX for unconfirmed users

## Current Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING
- Cognito configuration: Working
- Application integration: Fixed
- Email verification: Temporary workaround needed
