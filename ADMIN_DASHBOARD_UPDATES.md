# Admin Dashboard Updates

## Overview
This document tracks the recent updates made to the admin dashboard component to maintain consistency across development sessions.

## Recent Changes Made

### 1. Statistics Cards Removal (Completed)
- **File**: `src/components/dashboards/admin-dashboard.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed all statistics cards (Users, Active Desktops, Uptime) from the header
- **Rationale**: Simplified the admin interface to reduce visual clutter
- **Result**: Clean header with just "System Admin" title

### 2. Header Color Update (Completed)
- **File**: `src/components/dashboards/admin-dashboard.tsx`
- **Change**: Updated header gradient from `from-purple-500 to-purple-600` to `from-purple-700 to-purple-800`
- **Rationale**: User requested darker color scheme
- **Result**: Darker, more professional purple gradient header

## Current Admin Dashboard State

### Header Section
```tsx
{/* Header */}
<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-700 to-purple-800 rounded-xl p-6 text-white">
  <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">
    System Admin
  </h1>
</div>
```

### Features Preserved
- User Management tab with full CRUD operations
- Course Management tab with course administration
- Lab Management tab with lab controls
- All administrative functionality intact
- Dark mode compatibility maintained

## Design Decisions
1. **Minimalist Header**: Removed statistics cards to focus on functionality over visual metrics
2. **Darker Theme**: Enhanced purple gradient for better visual hierarchy
3. **Preserved Functionality**: All admin features remain fully operational

## Notes for Future Development

- All CRUD operations for users, courses, and labs working properly
