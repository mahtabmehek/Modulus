# Hydration Error Fix - COMPLETE

## Problem
The application was showing a hydration error preventing the page from loading properly. The error message was:
"Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client."

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Date object initialization in Header component**: `currentTime` state was initialized with `new Date()` which creates different values on server vs client
2. **Authentication state checks during SSR**: Conditional rendering based on authentication state before client hydration

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Header Component (`src/components/layout/header.tsx`)
- Changed `currentTime` state from `new Date()` to `null` initially
- Added null check in `getRemainingTime()` function
- Set `currentTime` only after component mounts on client side
- This prevents server/client time mismatch during hydration

### 2. Fixed Main Page Component (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- Added `isClient` state to track when component has hydrated
- Added loading state during hydration phase
- Prevents conditional rendering differences between server and client
- Ensures smooth client-side initialization

## Result
✅ **Hydration errors eliminated**
✅ **Page loads successfully**
✅ **No more blank screens**
✅ **Server compiling without errors**

## Technical Details
The fixes implement proper client-side hydration patterns:
- Avoid dynamic content (like Date objects) during initial render
- Use `useState` and `useEffect` to set dynamic content after hydration
- Show loading states during hydration phase
- Ensure server and client render the same initial content

The application now loads properly at **http://localhost:3000** with all multi-flag features working correctly.
