## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript

  overview: true,
  configure: true,
  testing: false,
  troubleshooting: false,
  submission: false
})
```

### Toggle Functionality
```typescript
const toggleSection = (section: keyof typeof expandedSections) => {
  setExpandedSections(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    [section]: !prev[section]
  }))
}
```

### Visual Indicators
