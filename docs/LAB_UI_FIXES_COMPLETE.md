# UI/UX Fixes - Lab View Enhancement Complete

## Summary of Changes

### 1. ✅ **Dark Mode Fixed & Theme Toggle Moved**

**Problem**: Dark mode wasn't working across the body and theme toggle was cluttering the header.

**Solution**:
- Updated `globals.css` to ensure full-height body with proper dark mode background
- Removed theme toggle from main header area  
- Added comprehensive theme selector to user profile dropdown menu
- Users can now choose between Light, Dark, and System themes from profile menu

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/globals.css` - Enhanced dark mode styling
- `src/components/layout/header.tsx` - Moved theme controls to profile menu

### 2. ✅ **Lab Sidebar Content Restructured**

**Problem**: Lab sidebar showed module labs instead of lab content sections.

**Solution**:
- Replaced module lab list with lab content sections in sidebar
- Added interactive lab content sections with icons and notification indicators
- Sections include: Lab Overview, Configure Default Policies, Testing and Validation, Troubleshooting Guide, Final Submission
- Clicking sidebar items now expands corresponding content section and collapses others
- Added notification indicator (red dot) for sections requiring attention

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/views/lab-view.tsx` - Complete sidebar restructure

### 3. ✅ **Navigation Breadcrumb Cleaned**

**Problem**: Navigation breadcrumb included lab content items, making it confusing.

**Solution**:
- Simplified breadcrumb to only show: Dashboard > Learning Path > Module > Lab Name
- Removed lab content-specific breadcrumb items
- Clean, hierarchical navigation that makes sense

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/views/lab-view.tsx` - Updated breadcrumb structure

### 4. ✅ **Enhanced Lab Content Interaction**

**Additional Improvements**:
- Lab content sections now work as single-expand system (only one section open at a time)
- Sidebar items are clickable and directly control content visibility
- Visual indicators show which section is currently active
- Smooth transitions and consistent styling
- Icons and notification system for better UX

## User Experience Flow

1. **Theme Selection**: User clicks profile → chooses Light/Dark/System theme
2. **Lab Navigation**: Breadcrumb shows clear path without content clutter  
3. **Content Interaction**: Sidebar shows lab sections → click to expand content
4. **Visual Feedback**: Active section highlighted, smooth transitions, clear indicators

## Technical Implementation
