# Multi-Flag Lab System Update - COMPLETE

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login/Register Routing Glitch ✅
- **Problem**: Dashboard would flash briefly when clicking login/register
- **Solution**: Updated authentication state management in `use-app.ts` and `page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `setUser` action to immediately redirect to landing page on logout
  - Added loading state check in `page.tsx` to prevent flash
  - Improved view initialization logic

### 2. Multiple Flags Support ✅
- **Problem**: Lab challenges needed support for multiple flags per question
- **Solution**: Enhanced type definitions and lab logic
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `Question` interface with `flags`, `flagCount`, `acceptsPartialFlags` properties
  - Updated `Task` interface with flag-related metadata
  - Modified mock data to include realistic multi-flag challenges
  - Enhanced lab view to track and display submitted flags

### 3. Task Completion Logic ✅
- **Problem**: Tasks needed proper completion tracking with check marks
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive completion system
- **Changes**:
  - Added completion status tracking for individual questions
  - Implemented task-level completion based on required questions
  - Added visual indicators (check marks) for completed tasks/questions
  - Enhanced sidebar to show completion progress (e.g., "2/4 completed")
