## 📋 **Content Storage Architecture**

As you asked about earlier: **"In a course, there are modules, inside those modules, there are lab contents, where is it stored?"**

**Answer:** 
- **Course Info:** `courses` table (title, description, department)
- **Module Organization:** `modules` table (sequencing, content_type)
- **Lab Content:** `labs.instructions` field ← **This is where the actual content lives**

**Example lab content stored:**
```
Lab Title: "Security Audit Lab"
Instructions: "In this lab, you will learn to identify common security 
vulnerabilities and perform basic security audits on systems and networks."
```
